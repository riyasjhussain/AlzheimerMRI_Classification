# AlzheimerMRI_Classification

This project classifies the type of a Alzheimer.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens. It is the cause of 60–70% of cases of dementia.

Dementia is a syndrome – usually of a chronic or progressive nature – in which there is deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from normal aging.
It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgment. Consciousness is not affected. 
The impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied and occasionally preceded, by deterioration in emotional control, social behaviou, or motivation.

Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that primarily or secondarily affect the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease or stroke.

Dementia is one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide. 
It can be overwhelming, not only for the people who have it, but also for their carers and families. 
There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care. 
The impact of dementia on carers, family, and society at large can be physical, psychological, social and economic.




The data consists of MRI images. The data has four classes of images both in training as well as a testing set:

Mild Demented

Moderate Demented

Non Demented

Very Mild Demented
